# ![Logo](/media/Logo.png) &nbsp; SFPEG List Utilities Components

This page presents the content of the `sfpegList-utilities` package of the **[PEG_LIST](/README.md)** repository.

⚠️ It applies to the most recent (unlocked) packaging of the **PEG_LIST** repository.
Some components and features listed here may thus not be available on the old **[v0](https://github.com/pegros/PEG_LIST/tree/v0)** version.


## Introduction

The **utilities** package of the **PEG_LIST** repository provides usefull extended capabilities
to the **[sfpegList-core](/help/sfpegListPkgCore.md)** package.

They cover a wide range of more specific UX use cases which may not apply in the majority of
implementations.


## Installation 

It may be installed and upgraded as the `sfpegList-utilities` unlocked package directly on your Org
via the installation links provided in the [release notes](#release-notes).

ℹ️ It requires the **[sfpegList-core](/help/sfpegListPkgCore.md)** package to be already installed on your Org
(as it uses some of its UX and utility components).
