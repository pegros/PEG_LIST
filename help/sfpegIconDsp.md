# ![Logo](/media/Logo.png) &nbsp; **sfpegIconDsp** Component

## Introduction

The **sfpegIconDsp** component is a pure display and interaction component enabling
to easily display various types of icons while masking the underlying technical
implementation variations.

It mainly relies on the standard [lightning-icon](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-icon/documentation) component to display standard [SLDS icons](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/) or custom SVG icons from the **sfpegIcons** static resource if the `resource:` prefix is used in the
icon name.

If the _dynamic:_ prefix is used, it may also use the
[lightning-dynamic-icon](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-dynamic-icon/documentation)
standard component (in _score_, _strength_ or _trend_ types, e.g. as `dynamic:score`) or the
[lightning-progress-ring](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-progress-ring/documentation)
one (if `dynamic:progress` name is used).
In such a case, a _iconValue_ property should be set to control the actual display state of the icon/progress bar.
 
This component is used in the following components:
* **[sfpegListCmp](/help/sfpegListCmp.md)**
* **[sfpegMessageListCmp](/help/sfpegMessageListCmp.md)**
* **[sfpegKpiListCmp](/help/sfpegKpiListCmp.md)**

## Display Configuration Options

The following display parameters may be set on a **sfpegIconDsp** component
* _iconName_ to provide the actual icon name to display as _prefix:name_ as in SLDS
* _iconSize_ to provide its size (small being default if applicable)
* _iconVariant_ to provide its variant (if applicable, depending on the icon type)
* _iconTitle_ to set a title on the icon (displayed upon hovering)
* _iconValue_ to set the current value state of the icon (for dynamic icon type)
* _isDebug_ to activate the console logs of the component (for debug)

```
<c-sfpeg-icon-dsp   icon-name={iconName}
                    icon-title={iconTitle}
                    icon-size={iconSize}
                    icon-variant={iconVariant}
                    icon-value={iconValue}          
                    is-debug={isDebugFine}>
</c-sfpeg-icon-dsp>
```

As icon names, the following options are supported
* **SLDS icons** such as `utility:check`, `custom:custom12`, `standard:account`...,
_iconVariant_ property being available only for `utility` ones
* **custom icons** as `resource:<iconName>` where each `<iconName>` should reference
(with its size) a SVG icon sprite in the **sfpegIcons** static resource (see further below)
* **dynamic icons** either `utility:score`, `utility:strength` or `utility:trend` with a
required _iconValue_ (corresponding to the _option_ of the underlying **lightning-dynamic-icon**)
but no _iconSize_ nor _iconVariant_ properties
* dynamic **progress rings** as `utility:progress` with a
required _iconValue_ and optional _iconSize_ and _iconVariant_ properties.

## Action Configuration

If the _actionName_ property in set of the component, an _action_ LWC event is triggered each time the
user clicks on the icon. The CSS is then adapted to highlight that the icon is clickable.

Such an event should be handled by setting the _onaction_ handler on the component.<br/>
```
<c-sfpeg-icon-dsp   icon-name={iconName}
                    action-name={iconAction}
                    onaction={handleIconAction}  >
</c-sfpeg-icon-dsp>
```

## Static Resource for Custom Icons

The **sfpegIcons** static resource contains all the custom SVG icons usable in the other components via the `resource:xxxx` syntax. If new icons are required, new SVG definitions may be added in the static resource for the new icon in all target sizes. The content of the static resource is easily accessible via the **sfpegIconCatalog**
App page.

![Icon Catalog Page](/media/sfpegIconCatalog.png)


In the following example, the `resource:total` icon is defined in both medium and small formats.
* the id of the sprite is built following the `<iconName>-<iconSize>` format
* In order to reuse an original SVG defined in other sizes, a transformation is applied to scale and translate the original SVG directives for a proper display. The general viewBox is in a `0 0 100 100` configuration and target sizes for medium and small sizes are respectively `32px` and `24px`.
* The stroke color has to be explicitely specified (as it is not inherited from the containers) and the stroke-width may also be adapted to the size.
