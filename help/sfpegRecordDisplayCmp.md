# ![Logo](/media/Logo.png) &nbsp; **sfpegRecordDisplayCmp** Component

This component is part of the [`sfpegList-extensions`](/help/sfpegListPkgExtensions.md) package
of the **[PEG_LIST](/README.md)** repository.

⚠️ This page applies to the most recent (unlocked) packaging of the **PEG_LIST** repository.
Some features described here may thus not be available on the old **[v0](https://github.com/pegros/PEG_LIST/tree/v0)** version.
See v0 documentation of the same component [here](/blob/v0/help/sfpegRecordDisplayCmp.md).


## Introduction

The **sfpegRecordDisplayCmp** component enables to display record fields in a structured way, with
a first top header section followed by a set of tabs displaying record fields or a related list
(via the **[sfpegListCmp](/help/sfpegListCmp.md)**) component).

Its primary purpose is for the display of Knowledge articles in Communities (Salesforce Experience Cloud).
It aims at providing a User friendly and nice looking display for these objects (far better than the standard
_record details_ component). It is also meant (ROADMAP) to support dynamic variations by Record Type and 
conditional display of content.

One key feature is also its ability to use SOQL instead of Lightning Data Service (LDS) to fetch the displayed
record information (for objects not supported by LDS yet).


## Component Configuration

ℹ️ Please refer to the [Component Configuration](/help/configuration.md) dedicated page to 
get more general information about the way the included components may be configured. 


### Global Layout

The **sfpegRecordDisplayCmp** is built as a standard [lightning-card](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-card/documentation) container, in which the following elements may be 
defined:
* the card title and icon
* the card header action set (via the **[sfpegActionBarCmp](/help/sfpegActionBarCmp.md)** component),
as well as a possible max. number of actions displayed to control its width
* a first content section containing a list of fields
* a second content section structured as a set of tabs (see [lightning-tabset](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-tabset/documentation) containing
    * a list of fields
    * a possible record list (via the **[sfpegListCmp](/help/sfpegCardCmp.md)** component)

Hereafter are shown display examples with:
* only fields

![Record Display Example](/media/sfpegRecordDisplay.png)

* fields and a list

![Record Display Example with sub-list](/media/sfpegRecordDisplayList.png)


### App Builder Configuration

Within the App Builder, the configuration is quite simple and mainly consists in
* choosing a **sfpegRecordDisplay__mdt** custom metadata record for global layout cconfiguration
* selecting a **sfpegAction__mdt** custom metadata for header actions
* opting for LDS / SOQL data retrieval mode

![Record Display Configuration](/media/sfpegRecordDisplayConfig.png)

Other properties enable to activate debug mode and slightly adapt the CSS for the wrapping container.
Please note that the _auto_ `Layout Mode` takes into account the density setting value chosen by the User.


### Metadata Configuration

The **sfpegRecordDisplay__mdt** custom metadata provides most of the configuration of the
**sfpegRecordDisplayCmp** components (fields, tabs, lists displayed). 

![Record Display Configuration Metadata](/media/sfpegRecordDisplayConfigMeta.png)

The main `Display Configuration` property is a JSON object with the following properties:
* `title` and `icon` to respectively set the title and icon of the containing **[lightning-card](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-card/documentation)**
* `variant` (optional) to set a tabset display option (see **[lightning-tabset](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-tabset/documentation)** for details, default value being _standard_)
* `fields` provides the list of fields displayed in the header section, each field being described as a JSON object with the following properties:
    * `value` is mandatory and provides the field value (usually leveraging merge **tokens**)
    * `type` provides the type of field (see **[sfpegFieldDsp](/help/sfpegFieldDsp.md)** for details about supported values, default being _text_).
    * `label` (optional) provides the label displayed above the displayed field.
    * `title` (optional) provides the title displayed when hovering above the displayed field.
    * `size` (optional) provides the size of the field value display, within a 12 unit grid system, default being 12.
    * `hidden` (optional) enables to conditionally hide the field (it should haev a boolean value, e.g. testing if the
    user has a custom permission via `{{{NPERM.xxxxx}}}` merge token or a boolean formula field of the record)
* `tabs` provides the set of tabs to be displayed below, each tab being described as a JSON object with the following properties
    * `label` for the tab label
    * `hidden` (optional)  enables to conditionally hide the tab (as for the fields)
    * `fields` for the list of fields displayed in the tab, described in the same war as the main _fields_ property
    * `list` for the optional **[sfpegListCmp](/help/sfpegListCmp.md)** component displayed below the tab fields, as a JSON object with the following properties
        * `title` and `icon` (optional) respectively provide the label and icon displayed in the list card header
        * `name` provides the developer name of the **sfpegList__mdt** custom metadata record to use for the list
        * `actions` (optional) provides the developer name of the **sfpegAction__mdt** custom metadata record to use for the list header actions
* `innerClass` enables to set **SLDS** CSS classes around the header section (containing the `fields`)

⚠️ **Beware** : when using **merge** tokens (see **[sfpegMergeUtl](/help/sfpegMergeUtl.md)** ),
please pay attention to the possible double quotes within the field values, which completely break the JSON parsing after merge.
In such cases, explicit **ESCAPE(((...)))** directives are required required. This is especially relevant 
when using this component with to display text or richtext areas.


## Configuration Examples

For the displayed component example, the configuration is the following.
```
{
    "title":"{{{RCD.Name}}}", "icon":"standard:campaign",
    "fields":[
        {"value":"ESCAPE((({{{RCD.Description}}})))","type":"richText","title":"Objectives"},
        {"value":"{{{RCD.Status}}}","label":"Status"}],
    "tabs":[
        {   "label":"Description",
            "fields":[
                {"value":"ESCAPE((({{{RCD.Objectives__c}}})))","type":"richText","label":"Objectives","size":6},
                {"value":"ESCAPE((({{{RCD.Messages__c}}})))","type":"richText","label":"Messages","size":6}] },
        {   "label":"Operations",
            "fields":[
                {"value":"ESCAPE((({{{RCD.Conditions__c}}})))","type":"richText","title":"Conditions"},
                {"value": "<a href=\"/{{{RCD.OwnerId}}}\" title=\"{{{RCD.Owner.Name}}}\">{{{RCD.Owner.Name}}}</a>",
                    "label": "Responsable", "type": "richText","size": 6 }],
            "list":{"name":"soslList","title":"SOSL List"}}
    ]
}
```


## Technical Details

It relies on:
* the **[sfpegMergeUtl](/help/sfpegMergeUtl.md)** component to fetch record data, either
via Lightning Data Service (recommended) or via direct SOQL (for LDS unsupported objects).
* the **[lightning-tabset](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-tabset/documentation)** standard component to display the tabs (see variants supported)
