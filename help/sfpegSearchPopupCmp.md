## Introduction

The **sfpegSearchPopupCmp** and **sfpegSearchPopupDsp** LWC Components are slightly 
similar to the **[sfpegSearchListCmp](/help/sfpegSearchListCmp.md)** component, the
main difference being that the search form and result list are displayed in a Lightning
[modal popup](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-modal/documentation)
instead of included in the Lightning page.

The **sfpegSearchPopupCmp** is a notification handler for `sfpegCustomAction` messages
sent e.g. via *action* notifications from a **[sfpegActionBarCmp](/help/sfpegActionBarCmp.md)** 
component.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Typical use case is to provide an **add** action on a list of junction object records
to search and select new possible target records to join.
