# ![Logo](/media/Logo.png) &nbsp; SFPEG List Extensions Components

This page presents the content of the `sfpegList-extensions` package of the **[PEG_LIST](/README.md)** repository.

⚠️ It applies to the most recent (unlocked) packaging of the **PEG_LIST** repository.
Some components and features listed here may thus not be available on the old **[v0](https://github.com/pegros/PEG_LIST/tree/v0)** version.


## Introduction

The **extensions** package of the **PEG_LIST** repository leverages the framework provided by the
**core** package to provide other interesting UX components for _App Builder_ or _Site Builder_
(such as the **sfpegProfileCmp** displayed below).

## Installation 

It may be installed and upgraded as the `sfpegList-extensions` unlocked package directly on your Org
via the installation links provided in the [release notes](#release-notes).

ℹ️ It requires the **[sfpegList-core](/help/sfpegListPkgCore.md)** package to be already installed on your Org
(as it uses some of its UX and utility components).

⚠️ After installation, you need to grant the `sfpegListExtUsage` permission set to users in order to
let them use the included components.


## Solution Principles

Please refer to the [Component Configuration](/help/configuration.md) dedicated page to 
get more information about the way the included components may be configured.
