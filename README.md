# ![Logo](/media/Logo.png) &nbsp; SFPEG **LIST** Components


## Introduction

This package contains a set of LWC components primarily dedicated to the display of contextualised actionable
lists of information (related records, KPIs, messages, fields...). Even though standard components provide 
more dynamic capatibilites over the recent releases (e.g. dynamic forms, enhanced related lists...), the
standard out-of-the-box **Salesforce** platform still misses some usual key customisation and actionability
capabilities which may be provided via configuration of these components instead of full custom code.

They are based on some common powerful features required to easily adapt the end-user experience via context
information merge and a rich action framework while providing extensibility via LWC embedding or LWC messaging
(client side) and dynamic apex logic (server side) invocation. They also focus on performance and user experience
by leveraging most of the browser side capabilities provided by the Salesforce Lightning framework. 



These components were built as contributions or examples for former and ongoing Advisory assignments by 
[Pierre-Emmanuel Gros](https://github.com/pegros), porting in LWC and optimising (for end-user performances 
and easier configuration mutualisation among page layouts) some components previously available in a former 
Aura component package (known as **PEG Components** not available on GitHub). 

ℹ️ This package has been recently repackaged to better isolate the core components from add-ons, 
useful extensions and configuration examples, following remarks and questions from the user community.
The older version remains available in the **[v0](https://github.com/pegros/PEG_LIST/tree/v0)** branch
of the repository.


## Repository Content

This repository contains a whole set of LWC Components for use in _App Builder_ or _Site Builder_
to enhance the UX, the main one being the **[SFPEG Custom List](/help/sfpegListCmp.md)** 
(displayed below in table format).

They come with rich and extensible frameworks for contextualization 
(via the **[sfpegMergeUtl](/help/sfpegMergeUtl.md)** utility component) and
actionability (via the **[sfpegActionBarCmp](/help/sfpegActionBarCmp.md)**).

The whole set of components (and this repository) is structured as 4 complementary
packages (with their dedicated folders and overview pages):
* **`[sfpegList-core](/help/sfpegListPkgCore.md)`** providing the core functionality of the
repository, with focus on the contextualised list component (**[sfpegListCmp](/help/README.md)**)
and supporting contextualization and action framework
* **`[sfpegList-extensions](/help/sfpegListPkgExtensions.md)`** providing other components to enhance
the standard Lightning UX and leveraging more or less the same underlying framework
* **`[sfpegList-utilities](/help/sfpegListPkgUtilities.md)`** providing useful extensions to the
`sfpegList-core` package (Apex extension classes, custom metadata records, wrapping LWC components...)
* **`[sfpegList-examples](/help/sfpegListPkgExamples.md)`** providing out-of-the-box configurations
for usual use cases.
* **`[sfpegList-dataCloud](/help/sfpegListPkgDataCloud.md)`** providing extra utilities dedicated
to Data Cloud integration.
* **`[sfpegList-legacy](/help/sfpegListPkgLegacy.md)`** providing original Aura components, most
of which have been replaced or integrated into other LWC components.

ℹ️ The [Component List](/help/componentList.md) page provides an exhaustive list of all metadata
included in the reporstory (with links to their _help_ page when available).
